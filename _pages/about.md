Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at
[University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu/). 

My research interests are broadly in Applied Microeconomics, Labor Economics, Health and Development Economics. I am also interested studying topics of discrimination and inequality with a focus on how preferences and beliefs affect economic outcomes; immigration issues and economics of education. I also work on evaluation of economic policies.
