Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at
[University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB)](http://www.buffalo.edu/). Prior to joining my PhD, I worked as a Business Analyst at [Genpact, India](https://www.genpact.com/). I received my Master's and Bachelor's in Economics from [Jadavpur University, India](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/).

I am on the job market for AY 2022-2023 and will be available for interviews at the 2023 ASSA/AEA Meeting and other remote meetings. 

My research interests broadly lie in the domain of Applied Microeconomics with a focused view on Labor, Health, Public and Development Economics. I work on evaluation of economic policies, economics of education, gender roles, intergenerational effects, immigration issues and human capital acquisitions. I am also interested in studying topics of discrimination, labour market inefficiencies of earning disparities and health of workers affecting economic outcomes.
