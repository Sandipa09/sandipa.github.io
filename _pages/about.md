Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at
[University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu/). 

I am on the job market for AY 2022-2023 and will be available for interviews at the 2023 ASSA Meeting and other remote meetings.  

My research interests are broadly in Applied Microeconomics, Labor Economics, Health and Development Economics. I work on evaluation of economic policies, gender issues, immigration issues and economics of education. I am also interested in studying topics of discrimination and inequality with a focus on how preferences and beliefs affect economic outcomes.
