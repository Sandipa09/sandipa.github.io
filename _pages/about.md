Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/economics.html) at
[University at Buffalo, SUNY](http://www.buffalo.edu/). 

My research interests are broadly in Applied Microeconomics, Labor Economics, Health and Development Economics. I am also interested studying topics of discrimination and inequality with a focus on how preferences and beliefs affect economic outcomes, immigration issues and economics of education. I also work on evaluation of economic policies.

My [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political
violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models,
geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I
also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic
statecraft. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both international
relations and quantitative methodology and am a certified instructor with
