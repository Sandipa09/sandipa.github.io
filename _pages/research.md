    This paper exploits an education policy in India generated by a 2010 schooling reform to examine the effect of education on fertility and related behavior. The key element of the reform was that it required students to complete eight years of primary education (age 6-14 years). An instrumented difference-in-difference approach is used that measures the exogenous variation in treatment intensity across birth cohorts. Some units of observation are treated at a particular time based on the policy enactment in a particular state as the treatment group and untreated units are interpreted as the control group. The reform led to an increase in education, a delay in marriage, and reduced fertility beginning at the age of 19. A series of robustness checks were performed. The findings suggest that postponement of marriage, reduction in the marital education gap, and increased early use of modern contraceptives contribute to reduced fertility. These results are consistent with women having greater control over their fertility decision.

- Exchange Rate Volatility and International Students’ Educational Choice: Evidence from USA

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    Does the economic situation prevailing in the home country of an international student affect his/her educational choice in the United States? To address this question, I use exchange rates as exogenous price shocks to the international students’ budget constraint to pay for the higher education in the host country. To theorize, in response to changes in real exchange rates, how the foreign students’ demand behavior in terms of educational attainment is affected is studied in this paper. To assess the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the choice of education made by the foreign students' I used data from several sources for the time period 2000-2018 to model variation in changes from abroad in enrollment decisions in the U.S. educational institutes. The results obtained suggest that undergraduate enrollment for foreign students are sensitive to changes in prices of education caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates. However, exchange rate fluctuations don’t affect graduate enrollment. The paper also exploits other economic indicators and availability of substitutes in the home country that affects foreign demand for U.S. higher education.

- Effect of Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Insurance Coverage by the Immigrants and Natives

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 included an expansion of Medicaid public health insurance to more low income individuals beginning in 2014. The ACA aimed to achieve nearly universal health insurance coverage in the United States through a combination of mandates, regulations on insurers, expanding Medicaid subsidies and health insurance exchanges, most of which took effect in 2014. This paper estimates the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) by utilizing difference-in-difference-in-differences model that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion in 2014 and comparing the effects among natives and immigrants. This study contributes to understand the limits of the ACA in reducing disparities in insurance coverage and exploring how patterns of coverage differ for different sources of insurance among the natives and immigrants. It is observed that the gap is lower in magnitude between the natives and immigrants in terms of public and Medicaid insurance coverage after the ACA implementation.
