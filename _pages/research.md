    Does the economic situation prevailing in the home country of an international student affect his/her educational choice in the United States? To address this question, I use exchange rates as exogenous price shocks to the international students’ budget constraint to pay for the higher education in the host country. To theorize, in response to changes in real exchange rates, how the foreign students’ demand behavior in terms of educational attainment is affected is studied in this paper. To assess the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the choice of education made by the foreign students' I used data from several sources for the time period 2000-2018 to model variation in changes from abroad in enrollment decisions in the U.S. educational institutes. The results obtained suggest that undergraduate enrollment for foreign students are sensitive to changes in prices of education caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates. However, exchange rate fluctuations don’t affect graduate enrollment. The paper also exploits other economic indicators and availability of substitutes in the home country that affects foreign demand for U.S. higher education.
