- Effect of the Right to Education Act in India on Fertility Behaviors and Marriage Characteristics

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    This paper exploits an education policy in India generated by a 2010 schooling reform to examine the effect of education on fertility and related behavior. The key element of the reform was that it required students to complete eight years of primary education (age 6-14 years). An instrumental variable difference-in-difference approach is used that measures the exogenous variation in treatment intensity in different states across birth cohorts measured by birth year and birth months. The reform led to an increase in education, a delay in marriage, postponing sexual activity and reduced fertility beginning at the age of 22. The paper also examines the pathways through which increased education affects fertility. The findings suggest early use of modern contraceptives, reduction in the marital education gap, increased literacy and utilization of healthcare services contribute to reduced fertility. These results are consistent with women having greater control over their fertility decision and increased empowerment thereby highlighting the importance of the policy efforts of the government to employ in their effort to promote education.

- Exchange Rate Volatility and International Students’ Educational Choice: Evidence from USA

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    Does the economic situation prevailing in the home country of an international student affect his/her educational choice in the U.S.? To address this question, I use exchange rates as exogenous price shocks to the international students’ budget constraint to pay for higher education in the host country. To theorize, in response to changes in real exchange rates, how the foreign students’ demand behaviour in terms of educational attainment is affected is studied in this paper. For estimation, data from several sources for 2000-2019 time-period is used. Although insignificant, I find international undergraduate enrollment decreases as prices of education increases caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate. However, this isn't true for graduate enrollment. The paper also exploits other macroeconomic indicators and availability of substitutes in the home country that affects foreign demand for U.S. higher education. The theoretical model further elucidates the empirical puzzle of the foreign students’ demand behavior in terms of educational attainment.

- Effect of Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Insurance Coverage by the Immigrants and Natives

    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 included an expansion of Medicaid public health insurance to more low income individuals beginning in 2014. The ACA aimed to achieve nearly universal health insurance coverage in the United States through a combination of mandates, regulations on insurers, expanding Medicaid subsidies and health insurance exchanges, most of which took effect in 2014. This paper estimates the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) by utilizing difference-in-difference-in-differences model that exploit cross-sectional variation in the intensity of treatment arising from state participation in the Medicaid expansion in 2014 and comparing the effects among natives and immigrants. This study contributes to understand the limits of the ACA in reducing disparities in insurance coverage and exploring how patterns of coverage differ for different sources of insurance among the natives and immigrants. It is observed that the gap is lower in magnitude between the natives and immigrants in terms of public and Medicaid insurance coverage after the ACA implementation.

- The Intergenerational Effect of Parental Education on Child Health: Evidence from India"
    <details style="font-size:80%; background-color:#fffbfa;">
    <summary style="color:#a51417; font-family:courier; font-size:100%;"> Abstract </summary> 
    This paper investigates the impact of parental education on child health, exploiting a compulsory schooling law implemented in India in 2010 that required students to complete eight years of primary education (age 6-14 years). It finds that it is maternal, rather than paternal, education that matters most for child health. There are also important differences in the effect according to child gender. Mother’s total years of education raises boys height-for-age by 0.163 standard deviations, whilst there is no statistically significant effect on girls height. Parental education appears to have little effect on weight-for-age of children. Estimated effects on height are driven by the rural sample, where an additional year of mother’s education raises boys height for age by 0.228 standard deviations and lowers the probability of a boy being classified as stunted by 6.6 percentage points. Results therefore suggest that - at least in rural areas - son preference in India has additional impacts beyond the sex-ratio at birth.
